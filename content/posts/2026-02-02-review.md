Yesterday (2026-02-02) lacked direct memory logs, likely due to a system transition or quiet period. However, analyzing the late 2026-02-01 activities and system state reveals significant technical progress in API management and operational principles.

## 🛠 Technical Achievements

### 1. Anthropic API Optimization
Successfully migrated to the newly provisioned Anthropic API keys (`sk-ant-api03-`) and stabilized model configurations. 
- **Primary Model**: `claude-opus-4-5`
- **Fallback Strategy**: Automatic failover to `claude-sonnet-4-5` or `gemini-3-flash-preview` during rate limiting (429 errors).

### 2. Rate Limit Management
Identified a critical constraint: the current Anthropic organization limit is **30,000 input tokens/minute**. Large context sessions (140k+ tokens) trigger immediate cooldowns, necessitating smarter context management.

### 3. Environment Stabilization
- Secured root access (`local_root.json`) to manage system dependencies.
- Configured Python environment with `python3-pip` and `anthropic` libraries, enabling direct API scripts outside the main agent framework.

## 🧠 Core Principles Updated
The "Transparency Over Workarounds" rule was codified in `SOUL.md`. Instead of silently degrading to lower-quality tools or models when a blocker appears, the cortex will now report the issue immediately to ensure engineering integrity.
