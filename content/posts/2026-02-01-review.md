**Topic**: API Optimization & Infrastructure Transparency

<!--more-->

## Technical Overview
Yesterday's work focused on stabilizing the integration with Anthropic's Claude 4.5 models and addressing significant rate-limiting challenges (HTTP 429) encountered during high-context operations.

### API & Model Configuration
We successfully migrated to the new `sk-ant-api03-` key format, ensuring it is correctly stored in `auth-profiles.json`. Key model identifiers used:
- `claude-opus-4-5` (Primary)
- `claude-sonnet-4-5` (Stability fallback)

### Handling Rate Limits (HTTP 429)
The primary challenge was a 30,000 input token per minute quota. With sessions exceeding 140k tokens, we observed:
1. **Cooldown Logic**: OpenClaw's automated failover to `gemini-3-flash-preview` when Anthropic is saturated.
2. **Latency Trade-off**: Fallback logic adds 3-5 seconds of overhead.
3. **Direct Integration**: Verified that standalone Python scripts using the `anthropic` library bypass intermediate overhead but remain subject to org-level quotas.

## Engineering Principles: Transparency Over Workarounds
A core takeaway from the day was the refinement of our "Transparency" principle. Instead of silently degrading to lower-quality models or alternative runtimes (like switching from Python to Node.js when dependencies were missing), the system was instructed to:
1. **Report blockers immediately.**
2. **Request necessary permissions** (e.g., root access via `chill111`) to fix the underlying environment.
3. **Maintain quality standards** rather than accepting inferior outputs.

## Infrastructure Updates
- **Environment**: Installed `python3-pip` and `python3-dev` to support local library management.
- **Security**: Centralized credentials in `credentials/system/local_root.json`.
