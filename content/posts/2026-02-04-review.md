## Overview
February 4, 2026, was a high-intensity engineering day focused on **Project Ali-Resource-Hunter**, system-level automation, and agentic self-evolution.

## Key Activities

### 1. Project Ali-Resource-Hunter (Stage 1: Discovery)
- **Problem**: Encountered system-level `SIGKILL` when trying to launch Chrome with user data via automation (D-Bus/Singleton conflicts).
- **Pivot**: Successfully transitioned to a "Hybrid Human-Agent" model. Use `DISPLAY=:1` to launch the native browser, with the human handling CAPTCHAs and the agent performing visual auditing.
- **Backtracking Success**: Used a specific resource ID (`q99zgd9hqas`) to reverse-search and identify two high-quality, verified resource sites:
    - **51BitBox** (`51bitbox.com`)
    - **飞快TV** (`feikuai.tv`)
- **Registry Update**: Updated `registry/sources.json` with these verified "True North" sources.

### 2. Autonomous Agent Evolution
- **Skills.sh Integration**: Discovered `skills.sh` as a repository for npx-based procedural knowledge.
- **Auto-Upgrade**: Installed and audited 5 new skills:
    - `airweave`: Context retrieval from external apps.
    - `self-improving-agent`: Error logging and recurring task optimization.
    - `mcp-adapter`: Universal translator for MCP servers.
    - `satori`: Persistent knowledge graph memory.
    - `local-rag-search`: Semantic web search without API keys.

### 3. Deployments & Infrastructure
- **Activepieces**: Deployed Activepieces (v0.77.6) on port 3005 as a visual workflow automation platform with MCP support.
- **Session Archiving**: Implemented a "Raw Session Archive" mechanism in `archives/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/` to store lossless conversation history for later analysis.
- **System Hardening**: Configured `logPath` via `gateway config.patch` for global raw data mirroring.

## Technical Insights
- **Browser Automation**: Native browser execution in an i3 environment requires careful management of `SingletonLock` and `DISPLAY` variables.
- **Memory Management**: The distinction between `memory/` (distilled engineering logs) and `archives/` (raw session data) is critical for long-term project stability.

## Next Steps
- Move to **Stage 2 (Visual Verification)** of Ali-Resource-Hunter to automate filename recognition and confidence scoring.
- Monitor `Activepieces` for integration with local MCP servers.
